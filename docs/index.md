# Spectrum

Game Engine

## Main Features

* `C++ - OpenGL - OpenCL` - High Performance Computing.
* `Test Coverage` - Built with GoogleTest or MSTest.
* `Cross-Plataform` - Spectrum supports Windows, Linux and Mac development with MS Visual Studio or VS Code and CMake.
* `Cross-Publish` - Spectrum supports publishing in many targets, such as Windows, Linux, Apple and Android (iOS soon).

## Modules
* `SpFoundation` - Spectrum Foundation is the base of the engine. It contains infractructure, such as Data Types definition, I/O, Socket and Connections, and others helper functions.
* `SpPhysics` - Spectrum Physcs contains all math and physics background, such as linear algebra library, collision detection and response system, particle system and so on.
* `SpPhysicsTest` - Spectrum Physcs Tests encapsule all tests for SpPhysics module.
* `SpRendering` - Spectrum Rendering is responsible for all renderable objects in scene graph.
* `SpFrontend` - Spectrum Front-End shows the window and all features provided by the engine.
